# CS-550-Fall-Term
This is a list of files from the fall term I am proud of / want t keep for further refrence
1. [AnimationTest.py](https://github.com/sushimaster1999/CS-550-Fall-Term/blob/master/AnimationTest.py)
    1. Originally created as a start for my own minesweeper game, the document was imported into our final group project for minesweeper.
    1. It includes code using a timer that might be helpful later on.
1. [Casino.py](https://github.com/sushimaster1999/CS-550-Fall-Term/blob/master/Casino.py)
    1. My text based casino project
    1. It contains useful information using lists, random numbers, printing stuff in the command line, and getting user input.
1. [ClassDog.py](https://github.com/sushimaster1999/CS-550-Fall-Term/blob/master/Class_Dog.py)
    1. A class based project.
    1. Details an example on class use, as well as code outside the class using information from inside.
1. [Poverwatch.py](https://github.com/sushimaster1999/CS-550-Fall-Term/blob/master/Poverwatch.py)
    1. This is a short piece of code that executes a certain file based on a users command. 
    1. Could be useful in the future. 
    1. Poverwatch stands for play overwatch
1. [Recursion.py](https://github.com/sushimaster1999/CS-550-Fall-Term/blob/master/Recursion.py)
    1. Example code using recursions
    1. I never felt that I really mastered recursions so I think this should be included.
1. [ramdomNumber.py](https://github.com/sushimaster1999/CS-550-Fall-Term/blob/master/rationalNumber.py)
    1. An in-class excorcise contuing our work on classes
